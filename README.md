 ABSTRACT 
 
 With  the  exponential  growth  of  digital  communication,  managing  emails  has  become  a 
 daunting  task  for  individuals  and  organizations  alike.  In  response,  automated  email 
 classification  systems  have  emerged  as  invaluable  tools  to  streamline  this  process,  facilitating 
 efficient  organization  and  retrieval  of  information.  This  project  aims  to  develop  and 
 implement  an  advanced  email  classification  system  leveraging  machine  learning 
 techniques.The  proposed  system  will  employ  a  combination  of  natural  language  processing 
 (NLP)  algorithms  and  supervised  learning  models  to  automatically  categorize  incoming 
 emails  into  predefined  classes  or  categories.  By  analyzing  various  features  such  as  email 
 content,  sender  information,  and  metadata,  the  system  will  classify  emails  into  relevant 
 categories,  including  inquiries,  requests,  complaints,  and  spam.Key  components  of  the 
 project  include  data  preprocessing,  feature  extraction,  model  training,  and  evaluation.  To 
 ensure  accuracy  and  robustness,  the  system  will  be  trained  on  a  diverse  dataset  comprising 
 labeled  emails  representing  different  categories.  Evaluation  metrics  such  as  precision,  recall, 
 and  F1-score  will  be  used  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  classification  models.The  benefits 
 of  the  proposed  email  classification  system  are  multifaceted.  Firstly,  it  will  significantly 
 reduce  the  manual  effort  required  for  email  management,  allowing  users  to  focus  their  time 
 and  attention  on  more  critical  tasks.  Additionally,  the  system  will  enhance  organization  and 
 retrieval  capabilities,  enabling  users  to  locate  relevant  emails  promptly.  Moreover,  by 
 effectively  identifying  and  filtering  spam  emails,  the  system  will  improve  overall 
 cybersecurity  and  productivity.The  project  aims  to  contribute  to  the  ongoing  efforts  in 
 developing  intelligent  email  management  solutions,  catering  to  the  evolving  needs  of 
 individuals  and  organizations  in  the  digital  age.  Through  the  implementation  of  advanced 
 machine  learning  techniques,  the  proposed  system  promises  to  revolutionize  email 
 classification, offering unprecedented efficiency, accuracy, and user satisfaction.
