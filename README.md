# Email-Classification
The EMail Classifier is an advanced email classification system designed to streamline the handling of email communications within organizations. This tool automatically classifies and routes emails to the appropriate departments, enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer service.


 # ABSTRACT 
 
 With  the  exponential  growth  of  digital  communication,  managing  emails  has  become  a 
 daunting  task  for  individuals  and  organizations  alike.  In  response,  automated  email 
 classification  systems  have  emerged  as  invaluable  tools  to  streamline  this  process,  facilitating 
 efficient  organization  and  retrieval  of  information.  This  project  aims  to  develop  and 
 implement  an  advanced  email  classification  system  leveraging  machine  learning 
 techniques.The  proposed  system  will  employ  a  combination  of  natural  language  processing 
 (NLP) and LLM  algorithms  and  supervised  learning  models  to  automatically  categorize  incoming 
 emails  into  predefined  classes  or  categories.  By  analyzing  various  features  such  as  email 
 content,  sender  information,  and  metadata,  the  system  will  classify  emails  into  relevant 
 categories,  including  inquiries,  requests,  complaints,  and  spam.

 # KEY FEATURES

Email Retrieval: Utilizes the IMAP protocol in Python to fetch emails from the Barclays email server.

Text Classification: Applies machine learning techniques, specifically Google GenAI (Language Model), to classify emails into predefined categories such as complaints, queries, or requests.

Routing: Uses SMTP to forward classified emails to the relevant departments or teams within Barclays for further processing.

Feedback Loop: Implements a feedback mechanism where human intervention can validate and correct misclassifications, improving the accuracy of the classification model over time.
